# AOT2-BGM-Modding-Tools

These are tools meant to help you replace the BGM in AOT2 with whatever you want.
The original scripts did not handle the .kvs headers at all, which caused problems. My updated scripts should solve that, at least for the most part. It worked for me 9 times out of 10, I seem to still be missing something. If you know what it is, please let me know or fix it and make a pull request! Would be much appreciated.

Please see [filename_table.md](this_file) for my compiled list of the song numbers and their associated names.
